# 🧾 Weekly Performance Dashboard for SkillSprint

This capstone simulates a real-world analytics task faced by entry-level data analysts. It was completed as part of my Python learning journey using `pandas`, built-in functions, and standard Python modules — with **zero help from ChatGPT**. Just old-school Google, StackOverflow, and blog posts from 2014.

## 🧾 Weekly Performance Dashboard for an Online Course Platform

You're a newly hired data analyst at **SkillSprint**, a company offering online upskilling courses. Your manager drops you a CSV file called `weekly_course_data.csv`. The file contains the following columns:

- `course_name`: Name of the course  
- `date`: Date the data was recorded  
- `completions`: Number of completions on that day  
- `average_rating`: Average course rating on that day  
- `order_value`: Value of purchases made that day for the course

### 🎯 Your Task

Prepare a quick insight report for the leadership team. They’ve asked you to investigate and present useful findings, but without giving step-by-step instructions. You’re expected to think critically and use your Python skills to explore the data.

---

### 🧠 Business Questions to Answer

- What are the **total and average completions per course**?
- Which course has the **highest average rating** for the week?
- Which **day recorded the highest revenue** overall?
- Are there any **courses with suspiciously low ratings**?
- What’s the **deadline to complete this analysis** before the weekly report goes out (assume every Sunday)?
- Is there any **punctuation or formatting issue** in course names you may want to clean before sharing charts?

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python built-in functions
- Modules: `datetime`, `calendar`
- Library: `pandas`

## 🧪 Reflection
This capstone was more of a **simulation than a tutorial**. It stretched my thinking, forced me to research independently, and helped me sharpen my problem-solving instincts.
